**At first time, run as follow:**

1. python3 Preprocess.py  # this will read dataset from /data, and generate data.map
2. python3 train.py # start training and validating after every epoch
3. python3 Cal_metrics.py # calculate recall, presicion, f1 of the best model on validation (run after step 2 is finished)

**After first:**

1. python3 train.py
2. python3 Cal_metrics.py
